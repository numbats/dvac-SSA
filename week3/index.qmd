R is great for data scientists and analysts who need in-depth control over visualisations.

**Pros:**

-   Highly customisable
-   Suitable for advanced analytics
-   Open source (aka. free)
-   Automation / reproducibility (more than plug and play)

**Cons:**

-   Higher hurdle to entry - need to code.
-   Simple tasks don't need customisation
:::

## Power BI and R

:::: callout-important
::: incremental
-   If you master data visualisation in both Power BI and R, you'll have a diverse skillset.

-   We exposure you to these tools, so you can see the full spectrum of data visualisation tools used in business analytics.

-   We know R is harder, but its is important to challenge yourselves! 

:::
::::

## Let's look at some examples

:::: callout-note
## Industry Applications of Power BI

There are many, many examples!

<br>

::: incremental
-   [Tourism Australia](https://www.tourism.australia.com/en/insights/tourism-statistics/aviation-statistics.html) *Which country has the most flights each week into Melbourne Airport?* [NZ]{style="color:white;"}

-   [Vic Health](https://www.health.vic.gov.au/infectious-diseases/local-government-areas-surveillance-report) *What was the most common infection in the Local Government area of Monash?* [Influenza]{style="color:white;"}

-   [Recycling Victoria](https://www.vic.gov.au/victorian-local-government-waste-data-dashboard) *How many tonnes of paper were collected from Monash City Council in 2022?* [52% 5860t]{style="color:white;"}
:::

::::

Notice these examples show mostly simple visualisations (e.g. map, line plot, bar charts) linked with tables. This is where Power BI excels.

## Your turn 

:::callout-note
## Your turn  

* Take some time to explore these dashboards

* Consider the ease of use and functionality

:::

## Example

![](images/lecture-03/bar.png){fig-align="center"}


## Polishing you visualisation 

When you are happy with the plot you've chosen for your data it is time to polish the plot. 

:::callout-note 
### Steps

* Update all the plot labels
  * Title, axes labels, tick labels, legend text etc. 
  * Use intuitive and intelligent labels
  * You must include units where relevant
  * Ensure the text size is readable!
 
:::

## Polishing you visualisation   

:::callout-note 
### Steps 

* Chose an appropriate colour scale

* Align your visual elements in your plot for clarity 
  * e.g. Think about legend position

* Check the final plot conveys the message you intend 
  * Be sure your plot proportions are good 
  * Check the range on your axes 
  
* May like to add additional text or colour to draw the eye to important parts of the plot you want to highlight

:::

## Your turn 

:::callout-note
## Your turn  

* Import the same data as me!

::::

:::: {.column width="70%"}

:::callout-note
## Visualisation Pane 

- Helps users to create visualisations

- Default visuals include: bar charts, line charts, tables, maps, pie charts, treemaps etc.

- Users drag and drop fields into the "Values", "Axis", "Legend", etc., depending on the type of visualisation chosen.

- Users can also import a custom visual from a file or the marketplace by clicking on the "..." icon.

- R and Python scripts can be integrated to create custom visuals and performing advanced data analytics.

## Barplots

::::callout-note
### About

This plot works best with variables of the type **numeric** and **categorical**.

::: incremental 

- Simple and easy to understand.

- Each level of the categorical variable is represented as a bar.

- The length of the bar represents its numeric value.

- Ordering bars and providing clear annotation are often necessary.

- These plots are commonly used to compare different categories such as sales performance across regions.

- Particularly useful when there are limited number of levels for comparison.

:::

::::

## Barplots

::::callout-warning 
### Common Mistakes

::: incremental

- Don't get confused with histogram (we cover this later in the course).

- Do you have long axis labels? Consider an horizontal version.

- Do not overload the plot with too many levels!

<!-- - Inconsistent axis scales: do not mix absolute values with percentages. -->

- Not sorting bars in a meaningful way 
  * Try sorting bars alphabetically 
  * Ordering the bars by decreasing/increasing numerical values

- Use of 3D effects on charts to make them visually appealing.

- Not including data labels, axis labels or a clear legend to explain the chart.

<!-- - Using very similar colours for all bars in the chart (especially in clustered or stacked barplots). -->

<!-- - Not adjusting for outliers. -->

:::

::::

## Pie Charts

::::callout-note
### About

This plot works best with variables of the type **categorical**.

::: incremental 

- Simple to understand at a glance.

- The circle is divided into slices that represent a category's proportion of the whole.

- Often used to show proportions where the sum of the sections equal to one

- For example, how different products contribute to total sales.

- It is most effective when used with a small number of categories.

<!-- - Pie charts are useful to show proportions of major categories--effective in highlighting the largest and smallest slices. -->

- Caution: These charts are highly criticised. Humans are very bad at translating angles to values. Best to avoid them when you can.

:::

::::

## Pie Example

![](images/lecture-03/pie.png){fig-align="center"}

* Note the percentages are the percentages related to the top 5 countries as we filtered our data. 

## Pie Charts

::::callout-warning 
### Common Mistakes

::: incremental

- Use sparingly.

- Do not use 3D effects.

- Do not use a legend, annotate directly each slice.

- Make sure proportions add up to one.

- Do not include too many slices.

- Do not include slices that are very close in size.

- Sometimes labeling the proportions are helpful.

- Do not use similar colours or distracting colors for slices.

- Displaying the slices in a random or alphabetical order.

- Do not use several pie charts one beside each other to compare them.

:::

::::

## Bad Pie Example 

![](images/lecture-03/bad_pie.png){fig-align="center"}

## Doughnut Charts

::::callout-note
### About

This plot works best with variables of the type **categorical**.

::: incremental 

- It is very closely related to pie charts.

- Therefore, suffers the same drawbacks as seen before.

- It is better to use them sparingly.

- Alternatively, we can use bar plots or lollipop plots.

:::

::::

## Doughnut Example

![](images/lecture-03/donut.png){fig-align="center"}

* Note the percentages are the percentages related to the top 5 countries as we filtered our data. 

<!-- ## Gauge Charts -->

<!-- ::::callout-note -->
<!-- ### About -->

<!-- This plot works best with variables of the type **numeric** that can take any value within a range. -->

<!-- ::: incremental  -->

<!-- <!-- - Somewhat similar to a doughnut chart. --> -->

<!-- - This chart is used to represent a single data point in relation to a predefined range. -->

<!-- - Commonly used to visualise performance or progress or status towards a goal or target -->

<!-- - Useful for real-time communication (e.g. voter counts). -->

<!-- - It spreads values evenly along the arc, from the minimum (left-most value) to the maximum (right-most value). -->

<!-- - The gauge line (or needle) represents the goal or target value. -->

<!-- - The shading represents the progress towards the goal. -->

<!-- - The value inside the arc represents the progress value. -->

<!-- - Colours are used to reflect the importance of different ranges, (red for critical, yellow for warning and green for safe). -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- :::: -->

<!-- ## Needle  -->

<!-- The example from lecture 1: -->
<!-- ![](images/lecture-01/needle.png){fig-align="center"} -->

## Treemap

::::callout-note
### About

This plot works best with variables of the type **numeric** and **categorical** that have a nested structure.

::: incremental

- Useful to visualise large numbar of categories as the plotting area is used efficiently

- Also highly useful for hierarchical data 

- It displays data as a set of nested rectangles.

- Each rectangle represents a category or subcategory within a larger data set.

- The area of each rectangle represents a quantitative value, such as sales, revenue, etc., with larger rectangles indicate larger values.

- Colours can be used to represent another variable (or dimension) such as a performance metric.

:::

::::

## Treemap

::::callout-note
### About

::: incremental

- In business analytics, these plots are often used to represent the relative proportion of financial metrics such as sales revenue or profit across various categories such as regions, products or departments.

- If we have many levels in the hierarchy (>2), it is recommended to build an interactive figure. For example, clicking on a upper level of the structure will reveal the next level and so on.

- Treemaps can be cluttered and hard to interpret if there are too many categories or subcategories with very small values.

- The area of the rectangle gives visual sense of the magnitude of the proportion. However, it can be difficult to pinpoint the exact value without labels or tooltips.

:::

::::

## Treemap Example 

![](images/lecture-03/treemap.png){fig-align="center"}

## Treemap

::::callout-warning 

### Common Mistakes

::: incremental

- Do not annotate more than three levels of the hierarchy as it makes the plot unreadable.

- Prioritize the highest level of the hierarchy as they represent the broadest and most meaningful categories in the data.

<!-- - Interactive charts are better -->

:::

::::

## Maps

::::callout-note
### About

Maps allow us to visualise **geospatial data** (it contains coordinate information such as latitude and longitude, which allows features to be drawn on a map).

::: incremental

Once the map is drawn, we can

- colour each region (choropleth map) 

- add points or bubbles (bubble map)

- reshape the region (cartogram)

- show the connection between several regions (connection map)

:::

::::

## Map Example

![](images/lecture-03/map.png){fig-align="center"}


## Maps

::::callout-warning 

### Common Mistakes

::: incremental

- Selecting the appropriate projection is important.

    + It ensures that our spatial relationships, distances, areas, and shapes are accurately portrayed, leading to more meaningful and reliable insights from the map.

- Indicate your source of information and the projection used.

- Using colours without obvious purpose could inadvertently communicate something that is not intended, potentially leading to misinterpretation of the data.

  <!-- + Colors often carry cultural or emotional associations (e.g., red might be associated with danger, green with safety). -->

# Barplots of Multiple Variables {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Types of Barplots

::::callout-note
### About

::: incremental

- Basic barplots can be extended to introduce a secondary categorical variable.

- The levels in the secondary variable divide each of the levels in the primary categorical variable.
    *e.g. 1. Country of Birth and 2. Census Year*

- If length of the bar represents the frequency (or count) of the primary variable, the secondary categorical variable divide each bar's length into sub levels.

- We can create three different types of plots:

    + Stacked barplots
    
    + Clustered (grouped) barplots
    
    + Percentage stacked barplots

:::
::::

## Stacked Barplots

::::callout-note
### About

::: incremental

- Each bar in a standard barplot is divided into a number of sub-bars stacked end-to-end, each one corresponds to a level of the secondary categorical variable.

- It allows us to see the composition of the total value for each level 

 - An example is comparing total sales from different regions, but you may like to know what categories makes up those sales.

- Use the domain knowledge or context to determine which variable will be the primary categorical variable and which will be the secondary categorical variable. 

:::

::::

## Stacked Barplot Example 

Good for comparing the total number of residents. 

![](images/lecture-03/stacked.png){fig-align="center"}

## Stacked Barplots

::::callout-warning 

### Be Mindful

::: incremental

- Ordering of levels for both the primary and secondary categorical variables.

- Choose appropriate colours to represent the levels of the secondary categorical variable.

- As the bars are stacked, it can become difficult to compare individual segment sizes across bars.

    + Especially when the segments are of similar size or if there are too many categories.

- One goal of a stacked barplot is to make relative judgement about the secondary categorical variable (making precise judgements are not as important).

- If precise judgement is important, we can use clustered barplots.

:::

::::


## Clustered Barplots

::::callout-note
### About

::: incremental

- Bars are grouped by position for levels of the primary categorical variable.

- The colours indicate the levels of the secondary categorical variable wihtin each group.

- It is used to look at how

    + the secondary categorical variable changes within each level of the primary categorical variable (within group).
    
    + the primary categorical variable changes across levels of the secondary variable (between group).
    
- It is not suitable to compare totals across levels of individual categorical variables.

:::

::::

## Clustered Barplot Example 

Better at comparing differences in the number of residents between census years for each country.

![](images/lecture-03/clustered.png){fig-align="center"}

## Clustered Barplots

::::callout-warning 

### Be Mindful

::: incremental

- Ordering of levels for both the primary and secondary categorical variables.

- Choose appropriate colours to represent the levels of the secondary categorical variable.

- If there are too many sub-categories or the categories themselves are too broad, these plots can become cluttered and difficult to interpret.

    + Especially if the bars are too small or there is a lot of overlap.
    
:::

::::

## Percentage Stacked Barplots

::::callout-note
### About

::: incremental

- A variation of stacked barplots.

- Each primary bar is scaled to have the same length.

- It makes each sub-bar a percentage contribution to the whole at each primary level.

- It allows us to perform a better analysis of the secondary groups' relative distributions.

:::

::::

::::callout-warning 

### Be Mindful

::: incremental

- It can be difficult to interpret small differences in the percentages between segments.

- If there are too many sub categories, the plot can become visually cluttered, making it harder to distinguish between the individual segments.

:::

::::

## Percentage Stacked Barplots

Shows the percentage by of residents from each census. 

![](images/lecture-03/percent.png){fig-align="center"}

## Small Multiples 

::::callout-note
### About

::: incremental

- Also known as faceted charts.

- It allows us to display multiple visualisations (or "panels") of the same chart type 

- Each panel represents a subset of data based on a specific category 

- Good for comparing patterns across different groups while keeping the visual structure consistent.

:::

::::

## Small Multiples 

::::callout-note
### Best Practices

::: incremental

- The dimension we use to break down the data should have a meaningful number of categories.

- (Where appropriate) Ensure that all charts within the small multiples grid use the same axis scales (for both the $x$- and $y$-axes).

- Use chart types that naturally lend themselves to small multiples, such as line charts, barplots, scatter plots, etc.

- Keep the colours, labels, and design consistent across all small multiples to make the comparison easier and visually intuitive.

:::

::::

## Small Multiples Example

## Customisation

::::callout-note

### About

::: incremental

- Custom visuals are particularly useful when we need a unique chart, graph, or visualization that is not available in the standard Power BI visual library.

- We can create custom visuals using R, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript.

- To create a custom visual in Power BI, we need the Power BI Visuals Tools (pbiviz), which provide a framework for building, testing, and packaging custom visuals.

- After creating the custom visual, you can import it into your Power BI reports.
