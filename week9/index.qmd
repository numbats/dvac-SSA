## Create ideas, not slides!

:::: callout-note
## When creating a presentation

::: incremental
-   Start with content and key messages instead of fussing over with
    slides

-   What do you want audience to take away or take action on?

-   What stories can you tell?

-   What headline is specific, memorable and concisely describes your
    talk?

-   The order you did the work is often not the order you should present
    the work!
:::

## Take Away Messages

::: callout-tip
## Building your story

Think about these key messages as your roadmap

Build your slides and visuals around them to support your story
:::

. . .

::: callout-important
## Take aways

If someone summarises your talk after - What do you want them to
remember?
:::

## Messages

::: callout-note
## Cognitive Load Theory (John Sweller)

We can only absorb so much information at a time.
:::

. . .

::: callout-note
## Practical Advice

-   Base the number of messages on how complex each message is

-   Longer talks don't need have lots of messages — just develop the
    ideas more.
:::

## Audience

::: callout-note
## Think about your audience

-   We can only pay attention for so long

-   Your audience will drift in and out focus

-   Give them opportunities to re-engage and catch up

-   Think about how much information they can take in
:::

## Contract

:::: callout-note
## Contract

::: incremental
-   As a speaker your job is try to communicate your work

-   As an audience member your job is to listen

-   If you break the contract as a speaker

-   The audience can and will break their contract
:::
::::

. . .

::: callout-important
## No hostages!

Do not try to take your audience hostage!!!
:::

## Questions

:::: callout-note
## Questions are good!

::: incremental
-   If the audience engaged with your talk you will get asked questions!

-   Getting asked questions are good!

-   So don't be scared of getting asked a question.

-   If something comes up you haven't thought of take it as feedback.
:::
::::

## Your turn

::: callout-caution
## Your turn

How many key messages can you communicate in presentations of the
following lengths:

-   3 mins

-   10 mins

-   30 mins

-   60 mins

# Designing your Slides {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Human perception

<br>

:::: callout-note
### From Messages to Outcomes

::: incremental
-   Principles of human perceptions and cognition extend to
    communication

-   After data analysis, you have to share the results or persuade
    others to take action because of the results.

-   Visuals and voice are better to communicate data than voice alone.

Let's look at some tips

## Text on slides

::: callout-important
## Don't do this!

Many presenters fall into the trap of adding far too much text onto a
single slide, which makes it extremely difficult for audiences to stay
focused, follow along, or even understand what is happening. For
example, you might start writing long sentences like this one, which
really doesn’t need to be here, but continues anyway simply to
illustrate that a slide can look busy, cluttered, overwhelming, and
frankly quite exhausting. People usually stop reading after the first
few lines, but the presenter keeps going, thinking that every single
detail must be included for the slide to make sense, when in reality the
audience is now scrolling mentally through their lunch options instead
of listening. Additionally, using small font sizes to cram even more
text onto a slide only makes it worse because nobody can read it from
the back of the room, and even those in the front row are questioning
their life choices at this point. Overall, this type of slide is an
excellent example of what not to do in any presentation under any
circumstances whatsoever.

## Learning Principles (Richard Mayer)

::: incremental
1.  [**Multimedia Principle**]{.monash-blue2}: people learn better from
    words and pictures than words alone.
2.  [**Contiguity Principle**]{.monash-green2}: integrating text and
    visuals can lead to more learning.
3.  [**Coherence Principle**]{.monash-orange2}: superfluous elements
    irrelevant can disrupt and interfere with your key messages

## Color

::: incremental
-   [**Visualise**.]{.monash-blue} Color matters so select carefully and
    strategically.
-   [**Unify**.]{.monash-green2} Be consistent with color use throughout
    the presentation.
-   [**Focus**.]{.monash-orange2} use color to draw your audience's
    attention to specific parts of your slides

:::

## Type

::: incremental
-   [**Visualise**.]{.monash-blue} Consider choices for text carefully.
-   [**Unify**.]{.monash-green2} Be consistent with your use of type,
    e.g. use only 1-2 fonts for slides.
-   [**Focus**.]{.monash-orange2} Use large text sizes. Minimum font
    size of 28 points is recommended.

## Text Slides

::: incremental
-   [**Visualise**.]{.monash-blue} When possible, convert text to
    visuals.
-   [**Unify**.]{.monash-green2} Maintain consistency across
    presentation using similar layouts and structure.
-   [**Focus**.]{.monash-orange2} Use hierarchy and layering technique
    to direct audience's attention.
:::

## Data Visualisation Slides

::: incremental
-   [**Visualise**.]{.monash-blue} Make use of preattentive processing
    and other cognitive principles to make it easier for the audience to
    absorb the information in the data.
-   [**Unify**.]{.monash-green2} Link text and visuals, e.g. legends
    directly in graphs.
-   [**Focus**.]{.monash-orange2} Remove or minimise non-essential
    elements.
:::

## Image Slides

::: incremental
-   [**Visualise**.]{.monash-blue} Use large, high resolution images
    that fill entire slide.
-   [**Unify**.]{.monash-green2} Be consistent in image use across
    slides.
-   [**Focus**.]{.monash-orange2} Link text and images to draw
    audience's attention.

# Quarto {background-color="#006DAE"}

## What is Quarto?

::: callout-note
## What is Quarto?

-   A tool for creating documents, slides, reports, dashboards, and
    websites.

-   Combines plain text & code (R, Python, Julia).

-   All our unit slides are made in Quarto!

- [Here is cheat sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/quarto.html) for how to use Quarto

:::

. . .

::: callout-note
## Why use Quarto?

-   **Reproducible:** text, code, and visuals all live and update
    together.

-   **Flexibility**: HTML, PDF, Word, slides, websites.
:::

## Parts of Quarto

::: callout-note
## Parts of Quarto

**1.  yaml header**  

-   Sets the title, format, options  
-   At the top enclosed in `---`  

**2.  Markdown Content**

-   Headings, text, lists, images\
-   The narrative part of your document

**3.  Code Chunks**

-   Differentiated from text using back ticks e.g. \`\`\` 
-   Work for R / Python / Julia code
-   Generates tables, plots, analysis
:::

## Example: Live Demo

Let's look at an example : File \> New File \> Quarto Document

. . . 

:::callout-tip 

You can swap between the code version and visual view 

:::

. . . 

:::callout-important
And don't forget to **Render** your document to generate the output file
:::

## Code chunks

You can control how code and outputs appear.

::: callout-note
## Useful options include:

-   **echo:** show the code? (`true`/`false`)
-   **message:** show messages?\
-   **warning:** show warnings?
-   **eval:** run the code or not
-   **fig-width / fig-height:** control plot size
-   **fig-align:** "left", "center", or "right"
-   **cache:** reuse results to speed up rendering

:::

## Your turn

::: callout-caution
## Your turn

Open a new Quarto: 
* Add some silly text, like 'My First Quarto', and 
* Copy the following code chunk, or create your own plot

```{r}
#| echo: true 
#| eval: false 
#| message: false
#| warning: false 

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(cars) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = speed, y = dist))

```

Practice changing the code chunk options:

-   so that no warnings or messages appear

-   the plot appears but the code doesn't

-   the code appears by the plot doesn't

# Scrollytelling {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Scrollytelling 

:::callout-note 
## Scrollytelling 

**Scrollytelling** is Scroll based storytelling. 

::: incremental

* Involves graphics that stick to the screen and and change as the user scrolls.

* It's one of the newer digital mediums.

* Useful for creating a layered narrative.

* Helps control the flow of information - great for cognitive load

* Here is an example from [ABC news](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-27/have-lessons-been-learned-from-2022-lismore-flood-disaster/101863278) explaining the progess of the Lismore Floods

:::

:::

## Closeread 

:::callout-note
## Closeread 

**Closeread** is a Quarto extension developed by Andrew Bray
and James Goldie for scrollytelling

* Income inequality in Vienna [link](https://mschnetzer.github.io/scrollytell_gemeindebau/)

* Country Flags by Population [link](https://bydata.github.io/population-flags/)

* Pension by Picture [link](https://calcwithdec.dev/posts/pictures-pensions/)

:::  

## Two main pieces: Stickies 

Closeread has two components: stickies and triggers.

:::callout-important
## Stickies 

* Stickies the things you want to **stick** on the screen (e.g. a plot)

* We need to give them a reference ID (sort of like naming a variable)

* The structure of the ID needs to start with a `#cr-` (e.g. `#cr-plot`, `#cr-image`)

::: 

## Two main pieces: Triggers 

Closeread has two components: stickies and triggers.


:::callout-important
## Triggers 

* Triggers are how you tell the Quarto when to make the stickies appear. 

* Use the ID of the sticky with an `@` (Sort of like a citation)

:::


## Do It Yourself

:::callout-note 
## Instructions

* Step 1: Install the closeread extension. (sort of like a installing a package) [See Getting Started](https://closeread.dev/)

* Step 2: Change the yaml header in your Quarto document to the `closeread-html` format

* Step 3: Add sections to your document to say where to start and stop scrolling. Here is an [easy example](https://closeread.dev/guide/) you can copy.

### Summary

-  Discussed more on tailoring your messages for the medium

-   Revised best practice in slide design

- Learnt how to create reproducible reports in Quarto 

- Discovered scrollytelling, and how we can create our own in Quarto

:::

## Answers

::: callout-caution
## How Many Key Messages?

**3 minutes** 1 key message

-   Only enough time to make one clear point with a short example

**10 minutes** 1–3 key messages

-   Preferably 1 strong message with 2–3 supporting points

**30 minutes** 2–4 key messages

-   Enough time to explore each message with evidence and examples

**60 minutes** 4–6 key messages

-   Longer duration allows depth, not more messages\
-   Avoid overloading—audiences retain only a few core ideas.

*This advice will change a little with situation and context, but broadly
will stay the same*
:::

## Answers

::: callout-caution
## To help people remember your messages

-   **Repeat them** — repeat the same message

-   **Use simple wording** — easier to remember

-   **Show, don’t tell** — use visuals to support your messages

-   **Remove clutter** — if it doesn’t support the message, cut it.

-   **Signpost clearly** — “Here’s the key takeaway…”

-   **Give people a chance to catch up** - Wrap up a section and let
    people re-engage

-   **Summaries points at the end** — close strongly and consistently.
