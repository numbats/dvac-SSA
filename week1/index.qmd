# Time to get started

Let's develop some intuition for why data visualisations are important!

# Famous Historical Visualisations {background-color="#006DAE"}

## A history lesson

:::: callout-note
## Cholera

::: incremental
-   In 1854 there was a breakout of the cholera disease in London killing 616 people.

-   At the time it was speculated that the disease was carried in the air.

-   A physician called John Snow was skeptical and began to collect data...
:::
::::

## Original Map

```{r,chlorera_org, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lecture-01/Cholera_Og_Updated.jpg")
```

## Close Up

```{r,chlorera_new, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lecture-01/cholera.jpg")
```

## Consequences

:::: callout-note
## Map of outbreaks

::: incremental
-   The map showed the cholera was more prevalent around a water pump on Broad Street.

-   The pump was closed down.

-   Eventually it was established that cholera is a water-borne disease.

-   Data visualisation saves lives!
:::
::::

## Crimean War

:::: callout-note
## Florence Nightingale `r emoji("heart")`

::: incremental
-   At the same time Great Britain was at war against Russia in the Crimean peninsula.

-   Florence Nightingale is famous as a nurse who treated the wounded soldiers.

-   She also advocated to the British Parliament for more sanitary conditions in military hospitals.

-   She knew the power of using data visualisation.
:::
::::

## Original Rose Chart

```{r, rose_chart, echo = FALSE, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lecture-01/Rose-chart.jpg")
```

## Recreation of Nightingale's Rose chart

```{r,rose_chart_modern, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lecture-01/rose-chart-modern.png")
```

-   Blue areas: Preventable deaths
-   Red areas: Deaths from battle wounds
-   Black areas: Other causes

## Aftermath

:::: callout-note
## Rose chart

::: incremental
-   The improved sanitation at military hospitals was eventually implemented in civilian hospitals.

-   Data visualisation saves lives.

-   Florence Nightingale became the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society.
:::
::::

## Napoleon

:::: callout-note
## Background

::: incremental
-   In 1812 Napoleon thought it was a good idea to invade Russia.

-   This campaign was a disaster for the French.

-   Engineer Charles Joseph Minard captured the extent of this catastrophe using visualisation.
:::
::::

## Minard's Plot

```{r,napoleon, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lecture-01/napoleon.png")
```

## Minard's plot

:::: callout-note
## Infographic

::: incremental
This visualisation provides information on [6 variables in one chart](https://closeread.dev/gallery/examples/minards-map/).

-   Number of troops

-   Whether troops advance or retreat

-   Temperature and time

-   Longitude and latitude

Despite the clear message that invading Russia in winter is a bad idea, some people did not learn this lesson.
:::
::::

## A bit more on Minard

# High Profile Data Visualisations {background-color="#006DAE"}

## COVID19 Pandemic

:::: callout-note
## Background

::: incremental
-   In the early stages of the COVID19 pandemic, hospital capacity was not able to cope with the amount of cases.

-   Collectively as a society we needed to to slow the spread of the virus and reduce the load on our healthcare systems.

-   People needed to understand and listen to the public health advice about hand washing, social distancing and quarantining etc.

-   Let's look at some visualisations that helped get the importance of this message across!
:::
::::

## Flattening the Curve

A visualisation showing the importance of slowing the spread and reduce the peak in cases ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening_the_curve)).

![](images/lecture-01/20200403_Flatten_the_curve_animated_GIF.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Social Distancing

A visualisation showing the importance of social distancing ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening_the_curve)).

![](images/lecture-01/Katapult_importance_social_distancing.gif){fig-align="center"}

## Communicating Climate Change

:::: callout-note
## Background

::: incremental
-   Climate Change is leading to more frequent and more severe weather

-   There are severe socio-economic consequences as a result of more weather and climate extremes.

-   It is important to communicate with people that our climate is changing.

-   It is also important to communicate that if we reduce our emissions and take rapid action we can slow down the impacts of climate change.

-   Professor Ed Hawkins (University of Reading, UK) [created data visualisations](https://ed-hawkins.github.io/climate-visuals/stripes-future.html) to help with this!
:::

## Warming Spiral

A visualisation showing the climate is warming. <br> This visualisation was shown at the Rio Olympics in 2016!

## Future Climate

A visualisation showing that our choices today will impact our rate of future warming.

![](images/lecture-01/Warming_Stripes_Past_And_Future.png){fig-align="center"}

## Politics

:::: callout-note
## Why visual political data?

::: incremental
-   Visualising election data helps people understand and trust the results

-   Common election visualisaitons focus on voter behaviour, such as differences in voters between regional areas and cities, or difference based on voters demographics (e.g. age, gender, income).

-   Visualisation also occurs in the polls in the lead up and on election night

-   Visualisation is also used by politicians to support their policy platforms

# Types of data visualisation {background-color="#006DAE"}

A world of possibilities

## 

![](images/lecture-01/world_of_possibilities.png){fig-align="center"}

## Matching the data the plot

There are lots of different kinds of visualisations.

But before we can create these visualisations ...

::: callout-note
## Need to learn:

-   Which type of plot works best for what type of data?

-   What are the different kinds of data variables?

-   What are different types of data?

-   What can those different kinds of data represent?

-   What can you show with that data?
:::

In other words: we need to learn how to go from [Data-to-Viz!](https://www.data-to-viz.com/)

## Discrete Variables

:::: callout-note
## Discrete Variables

::: incremental
-   **Discrete variables** can take only specific, separate values within a range.

-   Often represent **counts** or **whole numbers**.

-   **Example:** Number of students in a class, number of cars sold.

-   **Characteristics:**

    -   Finite set of values[^2] (e.g. Dice rolls takes values 1 to 6.)

    -   Cannot take on fractional values between two distinct points (e.g. can't saw in student in half!)
:::
::::

[^2]: This also includes countably finite, so counting numbers, 1, 2, 3, .... $\infty$, but that's a bit more technical.

## Categorical Variables

:::: callout-note
## Categorical Variables

::: incremental
-   **Categorical variables** are a type of discrete variable

-   Categorical variables represent categories or groups.

-   Often represented by labels or names rather than numbers.

-   Two types of Categorical Variables:

    -   **Nominal**: Categories with no logical order (e.g. your names)

    -   **Ordinal**: Categories with a meaningful order (e.g. low, medium, high)
:::
::::

## Nominal Variables

:::: callout-note
## Nominal Variables

::: incremental
-   **Nominal variables** are a type of categorical variable with no ordering.
-   **Example:**
    -   Blood type (A, B, AB, O)
    -   Types of pets (dog, cat, bird)
    -   People's names (Kate, Bets, Minh).
-   **Characteristics:**
    -   Purely descriptive labels.
    -   Cannot rank or order categories.
:::
::::

## Ordinal Variables

:::: callout-note
## Ordinal Variables

::: incremental
-   **Ordinal variables** have a natural order, but differences between values need not be meaningful.
-   **Examples:**
    -   Satisfaction levels (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied),
    -   Education levels (high school, bachelor's, master's).
-   Characteristics:
    -   Categories can be ranked.
    -   Distances between categories may not be equal.
:::
::::

## Continuous Variables

:::: callout-note
::: incremental
-   **Continuous variables** can take any value within a range.
-   Typically represent **measurements** (e.g., height, temperature).
-   **Examples**:
    -   Weight of a person (kg)
    -   Time taken to complete a task (minutes).
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   Infinite number of possible values within a range.
    -   Can be divided into smaller increments.
:::
::::

## 

![](images/lecture-01/what_do_you_want_to_show.png){fig-align="center" width="1400"}

Step 1: Is understanding what your data is.

Step 2: Is understanding what you can show with your data.

## Common types of data relationships

:::: callout-note
## Spatial Data

::: incremental
-   **Spatial data** represents data related to physical locations or areas.
-   **Examples:**
    -   Regions on a map (Country names) - Discrete
    -   Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) - Continuous
-   **Characteristics:**
    -   Useful for mapping and showing spatial patterns.
:::
::::

## Common types of data relationships

:::: callout-note
## Temporal Data

::: incremental
-   **Temporal data** represents data associated with time.
-   Examples:
    -   Daily temperature readings (°C) - Continuous
    -   Daily energy consumption (kWh) - Continuous
    -   Number of sales per day (Hierarchy: store, region, state) - Discrete
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   Follows a sequential order.
    -   Useful for trend analysis and time series forecasting.

## Summary

:::: callout-note
## Data visualisation is important!

::: incremental
-   We've seen examples of high profile and important data visualisations.

-   We've learnt when data visualisation is done right, it is a powerful tool for communication.

-   We've also seen an example of when data visualisation can be misleading.

-   An important part of this unit will be teaching you how to be critical of data visualisation.

-   You will learn what makes a good or bad visualisation, and to identify when a visualisaton is misleading.

-   We will revisit some of these examples in later.
:::
::::

## Summary

:::: callout-note
## Data to Visualisation

::: incremental
-   You've also learnt there are lots of different kinds of visualisations

-   We've learnt about different types of variables and what these variables can represent

-   This will be important for when we start building our own data visualisations

-   Take a closer look at the [Data-to-Viz website](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) to see what kind of data matches best with what plot.

This content is all made available in the form of pre-recorded videos.

## First steps

::: callout-note
## Getting set up

-   By the end of this unit you'll be creating your own amazing, data visualisations

-   Before you can do that we need to get you set up with the software you'll use in this unit

-   We'll now go through the steps to install R and RStudio

-   Think about R as the paint (raw materials) and RStudio as the paintbrush and canvas (tools we need to bring the artwork together).

## Installing R and RStudio

We'll open RStudio to create data visualisations using R.

:::callout-important 
## Step 2: Install R
- Got to https://www.r-project.org/
- Click "download R"
- Select a mirror (I use the Melbourne one)
- Install for your operating system

## Step 2: Install RStudio

- Got to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
(you only need the free version)
- Select download for your system
- Follow the prompts to install

## But Why?

::: callout-note
## Why do we need a Programming Language

-   It allows us to have reproducible steps, which can be applied for many different data sets

-   Make sure the analysis is not just point and click, you can work as a team on it on the same code

-   It also means we can more easily create our own bespoke visualisations
:::

::: callout-note
## Why do we use R?

-   It has been around for a while.

-   It is regularly maintained and is open source.

-   It is beginner friendly

-   Even if you use other languages, you might still use R for your data visualisations
:::

## Getting Started in R

:::: callout-note
## Learning a new language is hard!

::: incremental
-   You need to think about grammar and structure, and how to communicate well in it!

-   You will make mistakes, lots of them.

-   Below you see code that plots points showing the GDP per capita against life expectancy. The points are coloured by country and the size of the points shows the population.

-   It might look impossible now, but by the end of this semester you will be able to write this yourself!
:::
::::

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
plot <- ggplot(data = gapminder) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
plot 
```

<!-- ## How to learn R -->

<!-- 1.  Come to lectures and ask questions. -->

<!-- 2.  Look at your tutorial questions before the tutorial, & go along with specific questions. -->

<!-- 3.  Try to avoid copying code - instead focus on writing and understanding each bit. -->

<!-- 4.  Practice! The [Tidy Tuesday data sets](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) are a really fun place to start. -->

<!-- ## How to learn R -->

<!-- 5.  Have questions outside of class? Post questions on our discussion forum. You can also test out your knowledge by answering other's questions. -->

<!-- 6.  Completely stuck? Come to a consultation and talk it through with your tutor or lecturer. -->

<!-- 7.  Try talking to a [figurative rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) - sometimes just explaining the problem can help you find a solution. -->

<!-- 8.  Use ChatGPT to help get you started, or to diagnose your errors -->
