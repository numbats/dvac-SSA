## Theory

So far we have developed a good understanding of the theory.

:::: callout-note
## We have learnt:

::: incremental
-   The best practice principles in data visualisation

-   Know what separates a good plot from a bad one

-   Also know what plots work best for which variables

-   We know how to create a range of different plots

 - **Last lecture** Added how to polish our plots and describe them
 
:::
::::

## In Practice

:::: callout-caution
## Reality

::: incremental 

- Good communication requires the sharing and understanding of key messages 

 - A visualisation can be 'good' technically without communicating the key messages well


- You need the technical skills to process and visualise the data 

- But you also need the communication skills to get the message across to others effectively
 
::: 

::::

## Learning Objectives

Time to level up our data visualisation by understanding the principles behind good communication.

::: {.callout-important }

## Today's class

* Learn about basic communication theory and its connection to data visualisation

* Learn how to adapt the communication style for audience, message and medium

* Identify and apply rhetorical elements to improve data storytelling

# Communication Theory{background-color="#006DAE"}

## Communicating

::: {.blockquote}
To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.

[-- Anthony Robbins]{.fr}

:::


## Communicating [with data]{.monash-blue}

::: {.blockquote}
The two words 'information' and 'communication' are often used interchangeably, but they signify quite different things. Information is giving out; **communication is getting through**.

[-- Sydney J. Harris]{.fr}
:::

<!-- ## Communicating [with people]{.monash-blue} -->

<!-- <br><br> -->

<!-- ::: callout-note -->
<!-- ## Today -->

<!-- * Our definition of communication refers to **_human_** communication  -->

<!-- * We are interested in how people connect with and understand the key messages -->

<!-- ::: -->


## Communication is a [process]{.monash-blue}

Communication is often thought of as discrete, independent acts but in fact it is a continuous, ongoing process.

## Communication [competence]{.monash-blue}

<br>

:::callout-important 

## There is no single, ideal way to communicate

::: incremental 

* Good communication is situational and relational 

* Relies on understanding the where, what and who

* Or in other words: Medium, Message and the Audience

:::

:::

## The Where: Medium 

:::callout-note 
## Medium 

How do you plan to communicate your key messages.

:::incremental

- Verbal (face-to-face, zoom)
- Short form (tik tok, pitch)
- Visual or Audio 
- Report 
- Presentation 
- Formal or Informal setting
- Many more!

:::

:::

## The Who: Audience


::: callout-note
### Audience

::: incremental

* Colleagues or peers
* Managers
* Technical professionals
* Customer
* Students
* Policymaker
* Journalist
* Public

:::

:::


## The What: Message 

:::callout-note 
### Messaging

* So far we've used data-visualisation to explore our data

* We also want to use data-visualisation to communicate key messages

:::

. . . 

:::callout-important
### Need to think about:

* What is it you want your audience to know? 

* How can best can we use visualisation to communicate that message?

:::

## Communication [outcome]{.monash-blue}


:::callout-important
## Messaging outcome

<!-- Also important to think about what you want the outcome of this messaging to be.  -->

How do you want your audience to use or respond to those messages?  What is the outcome you want from the messaging? 

:::incremental 

* Inform: *Update their understanding*
* Persuade: *Change their behaviour*
* Inspire: *Help people think differently*
* Instruct: *Teach how to do something*
* Entertain: *Engage and have fun*

## Your turn

Try to explain the importance of data visualisation to:

* A 5 year old 

* A high school student 

* A peer at university 

* Your parent 

* Your boss

## Communication [competence]{.monash-blue}

:::callout-note 
## Competence

:::incremental 

* **Select the most appropriate communication** for a particular situation 

* Perfect and practice how you deliver that **type of communication**

* Consider **empathy** or perspective taking 

* Consider **cognitive complexity** and communicate at the appropriate level

* **Self-monitoring** reflect on efficacy of your communication 

* Be open to **feedback**  and where appropriate integrate it into your design or approach

## [Types]{.monash-blue} of communication

<br>

:::callout-note 
## Consider the type of audience 

-   **Intrapersonal** [-- communicating with one-self]{.fragment}
-   **Dyadic/interpersonal** [-- two people interacting]{.fragment}
-   **Small group** [-- two or more people interacting with group membership]{.fragment}
-   **Public** [-- a group too large for all to contribute]{.fragment}
-   **Mass** [-- messages transmitted to large, wide-spread audiences via media]{.fragment}

:::

## Communication is [symbolic]{.monash-blue}

:::callout-note
## Symbols

**Meanings rest in people, not words**

- Communication works when we agree on meanings.

- Need to ensure people interpret the messages in the intended way.

## [Effective]{.monash-blue} communication 

:::callout-note
## Effective Communication 

::: incremental 

* Communication doesn't always require complete understanding 
* We notice some messages more and ignore others, e.g. we tend to notice messages that are:
   * **intense**, 
   * **repetitious**, and 
   * **constrastive**.
* **Motives** also determine what information we select from environment

# Rhetorics {background-color="#006DAE"}

The art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing

## Rhetorical Triangle

<center>
<img src="images/lecture-08/rhetorical-triangle.png">
</center>

::: notes

Ethos - Writer. Make it clear why people listen to you
Pathos - Audience. Appeal to the audience to listen to you. Engage them.
Logos - Context. Audience will put things in context for them. Make sure it will make sense. (Example)

:::

## Rhetorical Situation 

Context and sitatuion matter!

:::callout-important 
### Consider these factors:

* Writer or Speaker 

* Purpose 

* Message

* Audience 

* Context 

:::

## Your turn

::: callout-caution
## Your turn

Consider these scenarios - What rheteorical situation? 

* The lecturer teaching ETX2250/ETF5922 is sharing material

* A social media influencer is promoting a sponsored product

* The Australian Bureau of Statistics reporting the latest job statistics

## 💡 Create ideas, not slides!

::: incremental

* 🪄 Start with content instead of fussing over with slides

* 🪧 What do you want audience to take away or take action on?

* 📘 What stories can you tell?

* ✨ What headline is specific, memorable and concisely describes your talk?

## Human perception 

::: {.callout-important }
### From Messages to Outcomes

::: incremental

* Principles of human perceptions and cognition extend to communication 

* After data analysis, you have to share the results or persuade others to take action because of the results.

* Visuals and voice are better to communicate data than voice alone.

## Keep it simple

::: callout-note

## Cognitive Load Theory (John Sweller)

We can only absorb so much information at a time. 

:::

<br><br>

Embrace [empty spaces]{.f-headline} in your slides!


## Be audience-centered

::: incremental
* Don't make your audience captives and waste their time away <i class="fa-solid fa-handcuffs"></i>
* Gift your audience knowledge and/or joy <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile"></i>

## Learning Principles (Richard Mayer)

::: incremental

1. [**Multimedia Principle**]{.monash-blue2}: people learn better from words and pictures than words alone.
2. [**Contiguity Principle**]{.monash-green2}: integrating text and visuals can lead to more learning.
3. [**Coherence Principle**]{.monash-orange2}: superfluous elements irrelevant to the teaching goal can disrupt and interfere with learning.
