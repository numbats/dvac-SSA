## Visual Communication

### Learning Objectives

Today we will look at examples of visualisation. We will practice identifying if key messages:

-   are appropriate for the audience

-   are they communicated well

To achieve this we will look at different examples of visual communication.

### Preparation

-   Take some time to read this [article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/02/11/trump-biden-immigration-border-compared/) by the Washington Post this article. If you can not access this article, do not subscribe, I will include the important plots below.

### Motivation

This lecture we want to look at visual communication and discuss key messages.

Recall this plot from Lecture 1, which has been used by President Trump to show how the number of illegal immigration over time and with different administrations.

The Washington Post used 12 plots to explore this same issue. Using these plots to provide more context to the rates of illegal immigration.

#### Some Context

-   Immigration was a key issue in the 2024 presidential race.

-   Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden in November, 2020.

-   Biden took the presidential office in January 2021.

-   Trump won the 2024 presidential election in November, 2024.

### Exercise 1

Discuss in your groups, the immigration plot used at Trump Republican rally's:

(i) Who is the audience for this plot?

(ii) What is the **key** message of this plot?

(iii) What are the important secondary messages?

(iv) Are the key messages clear and easy to identify?

(v) How does the audience influence the perception of the key messages?

### Exercise 2

Discuss in your group's the immigration plots shown by the Washington Post.

i.  Who is the audience for these plots?

ii. What is the *key* message for each of the below plots? 

- This plot shows the number of Illegal crossing at the US-Mexico border (2017 - 2023).

-   This plot shows the number of single adults, families and unaccompanied minors.

-   This plot shows the main countries of where illegal immigrants are coming from.

-   This plot shows the number of people deported each year.

### Finishing Up

The drivers and reasons behind immigration in the US are complex. The Washington Post created a total of 12 plots in their article to help understand the causes in changes in immigration.

This example shows that sometimes your data will be too complex for one plot! To understand what is happening in the data, we will often need to use multiple plots, each with their own clear message. Combining these plots together helps to create a full picture of what is happening in the data.

This example also shows if you obscure or ignore important variables that are important for understanding of patterns in the data, then this is another way to create misleading visualisations.

### Note

In Assignment 2, you will combine your own set of plots to tell a data story and share key messages.
